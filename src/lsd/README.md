To register a LSD here are the steps : 

0. Register the lsd in the env.json file
1. Register using the upload.ts script (don't forget to change the lsdName in the arguments)
2. Register the LSD exchange rate in the collateral price API (supported, steak like, stride like)
3. Create a proposal for adding LSDs into the platform
4. Adapt the frontend to reflect the changes (icons...)
